This game was developed by Hayden Gonne and Tae Hyeong Lim from April 14, 2024, to June 20, 2024.

The project has two branches: most components are in the master branch, while the APK and other files are in the main branch. The game focuses on learning about outer space, spaceships, and other celestial components through assembling and completing various stages.

There are four stages, each with a unique theme, and the game is designed as a simple puzzle game. It is intended for students and children in school to educate them about space science, but it is also enjoyable for anyone interested in the subject.
